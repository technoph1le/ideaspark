# IdeaSpark

**IdeaSpark** is a tool that helps developers *spark* their next big project idea. Whether you're looking for inspiration or just a fun way to generate ideas, IdeaSpark creates random words (or combinations) to kickstart your creativity.

## Why I built this

As a developer, I struggle with coming up with new and, often times, *good* project ideas. Over 3+ years of coding, these experiences taught me a lot. 

Iâ€™ve broken down everything I learned for coming up with good project ideas into 3 simple plans: `A`, `B`, and `C`. You can watch the first 2 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/@technoph1le), and the `C` plan (pure randomness) is this project.

## How it works

- **Single Mode**: Generate one random idea from the dictionary.

- **Combo Mode**: Generate two unique ideas, forming an interesting project idea.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use the `left` and `right` arrow keys to switch between modes. Press `G` to generate a new idea.

> The reason I didn't use `Spacebar` for generating new ideas is because it also got triggered when toggle switch (button) was selected. Since buttons can be triggered with both `Spacebar` and `Enter`, I didn't want to replace `button` with `div` as it would cause inaccessibility issues as well as didn't want to overcomplicate the code. The only quick solution I could think of was to attach it to `G` and call it a day. :)
